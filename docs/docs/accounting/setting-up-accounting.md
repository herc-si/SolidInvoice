# Setting up accounting

Accounting is off until you pick a tax regime. The regime decides which books you have to keep, which turnover limits apply to you, and how your contributions are worked out — so nothing else in this section does anything until it is set.

Click `Accounting` in the sidebar. Until a regime is chosen the page shows `Accounting is not set up yet` and a `Go to settings` button.

## Choose a regime

In the sidebar, expand `System`, click `Settings`, and open the `Accounting` tab.

`Tax regime` is the only field that matters to begin with. One regime ships today:

- `France — Micro-entreprise` — cash-basis bookkeeping: a revenue book, a purchase register for resale activities, and turnover declared to URSSAF.

The remaining fields have working defaults, so you can save after picking a regime and come back to the rest.

## Fields on the Accounting tab

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Tax regime` | Decides which books you keep, which limits apply and how your contributions are worked out. |
| `Main activity` | Used as the default for entries created automatically: `Sale of goods`, `Services (BIC)` or `Services (BNC)`. You can change it on any individual entry. |
| `Start of activity` | Used to scale a first, partial year's limits down pro rata, and to work out how long ACRE runs. |
| `Declaration frequency` | `Monthly` or `Quarterly`. Also the rhythm your books are closed on. |
| `Not liable for VAT` | Suppresses VAT on invoices and quotes, and prints the legal wording below on them. |
| `VAT exemption wording` | Printed on every invoice and quote while you are not liable for VAT. |
| `Flat-rate income tax option` | Pay income tax as a percentage of turnover alongside your contributions, instead of on your annual return. |
| `ACRE relief` | Reduces the social contribution rate for the first months of activity. |
| `Pension fund` | `SSI` or `CIPAV`. The two charge different rates on the same BNC turnover. |

:::info
`Main activity` is a default, not a constraint. A business that sells goods *and* bills for services records the activity per entry, and each is measured against its own ceiling.
:::

:::warning
`ACRE relief` needs a `Start of activity` date to work out how long the relief runs. Leave the date blank and the relief cannot be applied.

## What changes once a regime is set

- `Accounting` in the sidebar shows your turnover for the year, your books, and the period you are currently in.
- Every payment you record from now on writes itself into the right book. See [Your books](./your-books.md).
- Turnover is compared with the limits of your regime once a day, and you are told the first time you approach or pass one. See [Declaring your turnover](./declaring-your-turnover.md).

:::note
Payments recorded *before* you set a regime are not written into the books retroactively. If you are switching to Augias part-way through a year, add the earlier receipts by hand — see [Adding an entry by hand](./your-books.md#adding-an-entry-by-hand).
