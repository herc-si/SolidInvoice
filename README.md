## Why Augias?

Most invoicing tools force a trade-off: easy to use *or* respectful of your data. Augias gives you both. It's a mature, production-ready billing platform you can run on your own server for free, or let us host for a flat **$8/month** — no per-client limits, no surprise tiers, no lock-in. Built on Symfony 7 and PHP 8.4, it's designed to be extended, integrated, and trusted.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1 — Docker Compose from source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/herc-si/SolidInvoice.git
cd SolidInvoice
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Composer and frontend dependencies install themselves into named volumes on the
first run, so nothing needs to be present on the host. The application is served
on `http://localhost:8765`.

### Option 2 — Single binary

Get up and running in seconds with a self-contained binary — no PHP, no web server, no extensions to install.

**Direct binary download:**

Grab the latest binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/herc-si/SolidInvoice/releases), make it executable, and run it:

```bash
chmod +x augias
./augias run
```

That's it — open `http://localhost:8765` and you're invoicing.

### Option 4 — From source (for developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/herc-si/SolidInvoice.git
cd Augias
composer install
bun install && bun run dev
```

For production builds:

```bash
bun run build
```

**Requirements:** PHP 8.4+, ext-curl, ext-gd, ext-intl, ext-openssl, ext-pdo, ext-soap, ext-xsl, MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL.
