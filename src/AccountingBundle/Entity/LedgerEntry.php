 * recettes or a purchase in the registre des achats. Both live in this table
 * and are told apart by {@see $book}: they carry identical columns and are
 * always read the same way, only the direction of the money differs.
 *
 * This is cash accounting, so {@see $entryDate} is the date the money actually
 * moved, never the invoice date. Most entries are written by the feeders in
 * `Listener/Doctrine/` from a captured {@see \Augias\PaymentBundle\Entity\Payment}
 * or a {@see \Augias\BillBundle\Entity\BillPayment}; the rest are typed in by
 * hand for money that never went through a document.
 *
 * Entries are mutable only while their {@see $period} is open. Closing assigns
 * {@see $sequenceNumber}, computes {@see $hash} over the previous entry's hash
 * and sets {@see $lockedAt}, after which a Doctrine listener refuses any
 * further change — corrections then have to be made as a reversing entry.
