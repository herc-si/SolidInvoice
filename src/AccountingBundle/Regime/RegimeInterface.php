 * A tax regime — the single thing that decides how a company's books behave:

 * how often it declares, what limits it is measured against and what it owes.
 *
 * It extends both collaborator interfaces rather than leaving them to be wired
 * separately, so a regime is by construction complete: the registry can hand
 * back one object and callers never have to test what else it happens to
 * implement.
 *
 * Implementations are picked up automatically — see the `instanceof` tagging in
 * the bundle's `Resources/config/services/services.php`, the same mechanism the
 * electronic-invoicing providers use.
