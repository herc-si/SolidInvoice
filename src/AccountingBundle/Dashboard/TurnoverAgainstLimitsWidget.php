/**
 * Where this year's turnover stands against the limits the company's regime
 * sets — the one accounting question worth answering without being asked.
 *
 * Passing a VAT threshold makes a micro-entrepreneur liable for VAT part-way
 * through a year, and passing the regime ceiling two years running ends the
 * regime. {@see \Augias\AccountingBundle\Service\ThresholdMonitor} already
 * emails when a milestone is crossed, but an email is a one-off: this is the
 * standing answer, on the page the user opens anyway, while there is still
 * room to act on it.
 *
 * The widget lives in this bundle rather than in DashboardBundle because
 * everything it knows — regimes, ceilings, prorata — is accounting knowledge,
 * and `#[AsDashboardWidget]` is published precisely so a feature bundle can
 * contribute a card without the dashboard learning about it. SaasBundle already
 * contributes a checklist item the same way.
 *
 * @see \Augias\AccountingBundle\Tests\Dashboard\TurnoverAgainstLimitsWidgetTest
