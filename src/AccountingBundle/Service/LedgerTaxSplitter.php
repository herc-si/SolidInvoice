/**
 * Separates the tax out of a payment, the way the books have to record it.
 *
 * Augias keeps cash accounting, so what enters the ledger is money that moved,
 * not an invoice that was raised. A VAT return under the same convention — TVA
 * sur les encaissements — declares the tax contained in what was received, per
 * rate. Neither figure is recoverable from the entry afterwards: the amount is
 * a single sum, and an entry is immutable once its period is sealed. So the
 * split is worked out at the moment the entry is written.
 *
 * A partial payment carries its share of each rate, which is why this
 * pro-rates rather than taking the document's tax whole. The shares are then
 * corrected so they add up exactly: cents lost to rounding go to the largest
 * share, and net plus tax is always the amount that actually moved.
 *
