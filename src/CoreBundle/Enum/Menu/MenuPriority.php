/**
 * Sidebar order, highest first:
 *
 *     Tableau de bord — Tiers — Prestation — Catalogue — Paiement — Comptabilité — Système
 *
 * The value is a *builder* priority, not a position: it decides the order the
 * menu builders run in, and items land in the sidebar in the order they are
 * added.
 *
 * That has one consequence worth stating plainly. Quotes, sales invoices and
 * purchase invoices no longer sit at the top level — they are children of the
 * Prestation section built by {@see \Augias\CoreBundle\Menu\PrestationMenu}.
 * Their three values below therefore only order them *within* that section, and
 * all three must stay lower than {@see self::PRIORITY_PRESTATION}, or their
 * builders would run before the section exists and they would fall back to the
 * top level.
